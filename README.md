#### Abstract:
For my final project in mod2 at Turing School of Sotware & Design, I created a flashcard app for users to study prototype methods. 

---


#### Goals:
Provide a simple UI and seamless, empathetic UX.

* Craft code with clean style by using modular components.
* Iterate over large dataset to provide a user with the ability to study prototype methods.
* Give user ability to keep track of how many prototype questions they have answered wrong.

#### Challenges:
 
 I found it challenging to test some methods inside of my components using Jest and Enzyme. 

---


#### Wins:

I feel more comfortable with React now that I've done a second project. My understanding of props and state are becoming more clear and I am more confidently understanding how components interact with one another. 

---


#### Future iterations:

In the future, I'd like to add a study list feature that changes the 'Number Wrong' text into a button where the user can click it and the cards will display with a scroll bar for them to study questions they had gotten wrong.
