#### Abstract:
For my final solo project in mod2 at Turing School of Sotware & Design, I created a flashcard app for users to study prototype methods. Users can click on each method button and the button stays active so that they know which methods they're practicing, can enter their answer based off of the placeholder example text, can click submit to see if their answer was right or wrong, can click 'learn more' on the card to take them to the MDN docs on the method, and can see how many answers they got wrong throughout their time using the app(persists on page load). The app is fully responsive down to 320px mobile view.

#### Goals:
Provide a simple UI and seamless, empathetic UX.

* Craft code with clean style by using modular components.
* Iterate over large dataset to provide a user with the ability to study prototype methods.
* Give user ability to keep track of how many prototype questions they have answered wrong.

#### Challenges:
 
I found it challenging to test some methods inside of my components using Jest and Enzyme. Due to time constraints, I had to pivot from my original idea in my wireframe of the scroll bar so, instead it has become a future iteration.

---


#### Wins:

I feel more comfortable with React now that I've done a second project. My understanding of props and state are becoming more clear and I am more confidently understanding how components interact with one another. 

---


#### Future iterations:

In the future, I'd like to add a study list feature that changes the 'Number wrong' text into a button where the user can click this button and the cards will display with a scroll bar for them to study questions they had gotten wrong.
